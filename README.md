For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Calendar form:
    1. go to the "Calendar" page
    2. Click on the + sign
    3. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

2. Tasks form:
    1. Go to the "Tasks" page
    2. Click on the textbox
    3. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

3. Notes form:
